# SpoofSphere
Bend reality with codeâ€”spoof GPS and rewrite your coordinates like a ghost.

Installation for Linux:

sudo apt update <br>
sudo apt upgrade <br>
git clone https://github.com/Error2k25/SpoofSphere.git <br>
cd SpoofSphere <br>
sudo apt install npm <br>
npm init -y <br>
npm install express <br>
node server.js

Now forward the port to the victim (For port forwarding, I'm using ngrok)

Take a new Terminal && run this command: <br>
ngrok http 3000

That's it. Now wait for click of the victim.
